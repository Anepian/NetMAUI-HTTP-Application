# NetMAUI-HTTP-Application
In this repository there is a .NET MAUI project that uses HTTP functions.

## Warning: 
1. This app was developed as a university project, so most of the project is in Spanish.

2. This project does not have licenses, so you can use it in the way that best suits you.

3. Replace the links to the APIS that come in the program, these no longer have a linked database so you will not receive a response to the requests.
